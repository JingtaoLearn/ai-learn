# OpenClaw

Self-hosted AI agent framework with multi-model support. Runs directly on the VM host (not in Docker).

## Overview

OpenClaw provides an AI agent gateway with access to multiple LLM providers:
- **Primary**: Claude Opus 4.6 (fast mode) via Maestro Anthropic API
- **Fallback**: GPT-5.3 Codex via OpenAI API (OAuth)

The system runs as two systemd user services:
- **openclaw-gateway** (port 18789) - Main agent gateway
- **openclaw-proxy** (port 19999) - OpenAI-compatible reverse proxy (legacy support)
