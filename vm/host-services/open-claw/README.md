# Open Claw

Self-hosted AI Agent framework with multi-platform messaging support.

## Deployment

Open Claw runs directly on the VM host (not in Docker).

> **Note:** This is a placeholder. Migration from the Docker-based configuration in the original `machines/scripts` repository is planned. Refer to the original setup for reference during migration.
